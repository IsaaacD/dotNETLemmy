# dotNETLemmy

## Summary

**dotNETLemmy** is an HTTP API helper for [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) implemented in .NET 7  which provides helper functions and types for generating requests and deserializing responses to the Lemmy API. The implementation was modeled after [lemmy-js-client](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client).

Support is only included for the HTTP API, since Lemmy has opted to remove the websocket API that was once available.
